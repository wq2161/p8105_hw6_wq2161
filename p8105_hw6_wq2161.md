## Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis.

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv")

# Check for missing data
sum(is.na(birthweight))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
birthweight = birthweight %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = recode(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    frace = factor(frace, ordered = FALSE),
    malform = recode(malform, `0` = "absent", `1` = "present"),
    mrace = factor(mrace, ordered = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  relocate(bwt)

birthweight
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight.

``` r
model_1 = lm(bwt ~ babysex + wtgain, data = birthweight)

birthweight %>% 
  add_residuals(model_1) %>% 
  add_predictions(model_1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Model 1 Residuals Against Fitted Values",
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "Residuals",
    caption = "Data From birthweight"
  )
```

I made this model by hypothesizing that birth weight is associated with
baby’s sex and mother’s weight gain during pregnancy.

Compare the model to two others.

``` r
model_2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)

model_3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight)

cv_df = crossv_mc(birthweight, 100)

cv_df =
  cv_df %>%
   mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    mod_1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + wtgain, data = .x)),
    mod_2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    mod_3 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = as_tibble(.x)))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_1 = map2_dbl(mod_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_2 = map2_dbl(mod_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_3 = map2_dbl(mod_3, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  labs(
    title = "The Average Prediction Error of Each Model",
    x = "Model",
    y = "RMSE",
    caption = "Data from birthweight"
  )
```
